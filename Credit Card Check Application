# Two for loops are used. One is used to keep track of the odd numbers and add them up. This is done be counting the

# This is done be counting the even numbers from the left-hand side to the right-hand side and adding the odd numbers
# into the oddNum variable. The even numbers are doubled and divided into two part by using the // and % math
# operators and then added all up into the evenNum variable. The // operator takes the whole number from the
# divison, while the % operator will take the decimal remainder from the division.
